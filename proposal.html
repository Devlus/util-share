<h1> In a paragraph or two, what is your app idea?</h1>
Our idea is to create a website that allows for individuals to easily request repayment from their
 roommates for shared expenses. The site will allow you to upload some form of evidence (screenshot or the like) of
 a bill that you paid, and request payments from your roommates. You will be able to track who has paid and when. You will 
 be able to create a "Household" with your roommates in order to easily split recurring payments and requests.


<h1>What public api / dataset are you going to use?</h1>
Our plan was to use the Venmo web api, but since it isn't publicly available, we are tentatively going to use paypal's api. This will be used 
for requesting payment (between peers), and monitoring payment.


<h1> What data are you going to push to the client with websockets?</h1>
Live updates of who has paid and when will be facilitated via websockets. Also push notifications when a request is created for your to pay.
